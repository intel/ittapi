iJIT_NotifyEvent
================


Reports information about JIT-compiled code to the agent.


Syntax
------

.. code:: cpp


    int iJIT_NotifyEvent(iJIT_JVM_EVENT event_type, void EventSpecificData);


Description
-----------


The ``iJIT_NotifyEvent``\ function sends a notification of
``event_type`` with the data pointed by ``EventSpecificData`` to the
agent. The reported information is used to attribute samples obtained
from any profiling tool collector. This API needs to be called
after JIT compilation and before the first entry into the JIT-compiled
code.


Input Parameters
----------------


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     Parameter   
     -     Description   
   * -     \ ``iJIT_JVM_EVENT event_type``\    
     -     Notification code sent to the agent. See a complete list of
           `event types <#EVENT_TYPE>`__ below.    
   * -     \ ``void *EventSpecificData``\    
     -     Pointer to `event specific data <#STRUCTURE>`__.   




The following values are allowed for ``event_type``:


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * - 
     -     Send this notification after a JITted method has been loaded into
           memory, and possibly JIT compiled, but before the code is executed.
           Use the ``iJIT_Method_Load`` structure for ``EventSpecificData``.
           The return value of ``iJIT_NotifyEvent``\ is undefined.    
   * -     \ ``iJVM_EVENT_TYPE_SHUTDOWN``\    
     -     Send this notification to terminate profiling. Use NULL for
           ``EventSpecificData``. ``iJIT_NotifyEvent`` returns 1 on success.   
   * -     \ ``JVM_EVENT_TYPE_METHOD_UPDATE``\    
     -     Send this notification to provide new content for a previously reported
           dynamic code. The previous content will be invalidated starting from the
           time of the notification. Use the ``iJIT_Method_Load`` structure for
           ``EventSpecificData`` with the following required fields:   
   * - 
     -     Send this notification when an inline dynamic code is JIT compiled and
           loaded into memory by the JIT engine, but before the parent code region
           starts executing. Use the ``iJIT_Method_Inline_Load``
           structure for ``EventSpecificData``.   
   * - 
     -     Send this notification when a dynamic code is JIT compiled and loaded into
           memory by the JIT engine, but before the code is executed. Use the
           ``iJIT_Method_Load_V2`` structure for ``EventSpecificData``.   




The following structures can be used for ``EventSpecificData``:

**LineNumberInfo Structure**


Use the ``LineNumberInfo`` structure to describe a single entry in the
line number information of a code region. A table of line number entries
provides information about how the reported code region is mapped to
source file. Profiling tool uses line number information to attribute
the samples (virtual address) to a line number. It is acceptable to
report different code addresses for the same source line:


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     \ **Offset**\    
     -     \ **Line Number**\    
   * -      1    
     -     2    
   * -     12    
     -     4    
   * -     15    
     -     2   
   * -     18    
     -     1   
   * -     21    
     -     30   




Profilers construct the following table using the client data:


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     \ **Code sub-range**\    
     -     \ **Line Number**\    
   * -      0-1    
     -     2    
   * -     1-12    
     -     4    
   * -     12-15    
     -     2   
   * -     15-18    
     -     1   
   * -     18-21    
     -     30   




The ``LineNumberInfo`` structure has the following fields:


.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 0

   * -     Field    
     -     Description    
   * -     \ ``unsigned int Offset``\    
     -     Opcode byte offset from the beginning of the method.    
   * -     \ ``unsigned int LineNumber``\    
     -     Matching source line number offset (from beginning of source file).    




Return Values
-------------


The return values are dependent on the particular ``iJIT_JVM_EVENT``.
