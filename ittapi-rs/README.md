# ittapi-rs

This package contains Rust bindings for the `ittapi` library--it is equivalent to a crate using [the
`*-sys` convention][convention] but named differently for historical reasons. The `ittapi` library
is used for various aspects of Intel&reg; profiling; it exposes the Instrumentation and Tracing
Technology (ITT) API as well as the Just-In-Time (JIT) Profiling API. More details about `ittapi`
are available on its [README].

[convention]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages

> IMPORTANT NOTE: this package is currently only tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms but
> support for other platforms is intended; contributions are welcome!

### Use

```toml
[dependencies]
ittapi = "0.1"
```


### Build

```
cargo build
```

Building `ittapi-rs` will build the `ittapi` C library and link it statically into your application;
see the [build.rs] file.

[build.rs]: https://github.com/intel/ittapi/blob/master/ittapi-rs/build.rs


### Test

```sh
cargo test
```

This crate's tests ensure the `ittapi-rs` bindings remain up to date with the [official C header
files]; they do not check `ittapi` functionality.

### Regenerate Bindings

If the `ittapi-rs` bindings are not up to date, they can be regenerated with:

```sh
BLESS=1 cargo test
```

The binding generation uses `bindgen`. An in-depth description of how to use `bindgen` is available
in [the `bindgen` documentation][bindgen docs].
